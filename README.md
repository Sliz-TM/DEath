This is the <b>official EPA (Executable Program Apt)</b> for <b>Ubuntu</b> The troll for friends is the simplest for this OS


# Install for Ubuntu

1)Open <b>Terminal</b>

2)Enter: <b>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sliz/death</b>

3)Then Enter: <b>sudo apt update</b>

4)And Enter: <b>sudo apt install death</b>

3)To <b>Start</b> a programm enter: DEath (death doesn't work)

<b>If something is <b>not working properly</b>, does not load or does not work then write to the administrator: <b>abs.mark.photo@gmail.com</b>

# P.S

This executable apt program works only through ppa:sliz/death but in the future we want to add the ability to download it through the official Ubuntu repositories, i.e.: sudo apt install death without anything else
